maildrop (2.7.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Pattern searches are now specified in UTF-8.  The maildrop program 
  MIME-decodes the mail headers and contents and transcodes them to
  the UTF-8 character set for searching purposes.  You may need to 
  adjust your pattern search rules if you used latin-1 encoding etc..
