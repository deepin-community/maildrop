  * Non-maintainer upload by the security team
  * Fix privilege escalation via maildrop -d which grants root group
    privileges (Closes: #564601) Thanks to Sam Varshavchik

 -- Steffen Joeris <white@debian.org>  Thu, 28 Jan 2010 20:24:22 +0100

maildrop (2.2.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made the install rule a prerequisite for binary-arch as well as
    binary, which should unscrew the buildd builds, closes: #555156.
  * Reduced the dependency on a local MTA to a Recommends, closes: #537962.

 -- Josip Rodin <joy-packages@debian.org>  Mon, 09 Nov 2009 00:19:46 +0100

maildrop (2.2.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added libtool to the build-depends because a clean rebuild implicitly
    requires it and most buildds failed because of it. (Also temporary.)

 -- Josip Rodin <joy-packages@debian.org>  Sun, 08 Nov 2009 11:35:33 +0100

maildrop (2.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
    + Updated copyright license to GPL v3.
    + Delivery to pipes should no longer fail if the command causes -EPIPE
      but otherwise succeeds. It still prints the first error message
      ("maildrop: error writing to mailbox.") to stderr, but we have been
      recommending callers to ignore such output in when maildrop's own
      return code is not a failure, closes: #332543.
    + Dropped the fixes for automake fixes :)
  * Explicitly added --with-db=gdbm just to make sure we keep the old
    default.
  * Added manual courier-authlib dependency to work around #554788.
  * Added binary-or-shlib-defines-rpath /usr/lib/courier-authlib lintian
    override, this RPATH must continue to exist to work around #378241.
  * While at it, wrote down the lintian overrides for other two issues
    we've been carrying around intentionally.
  * Removed the default -O2 from CFLAGS on arm to work around #471258,
    closes: #471250.
  * Switched from cdbs + simple patchsys to debhelper dh (v7) and quilt.
  * Added README.source for quilt.
  * Upped standards version to 3.8.3.
  * Re-added the patch for makedat docs, our default automake is the same
    and our default autoconf is a tad newer than upstream, so it should
    work. Added temporary build-depends on automake and autoconf.
  * Removed Andres from Uploaders at his request.

 -- Josip Rodin <joy-packages@debian.org>  Fri, 06 Nov 2009 10:34:05 +0100

maildrop (2.0.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Integrated 010-makedat-doc-install.patch into the main .diff.gz
    for now, because otherwise we have to build-depend on automake 1.9,
    too (lest the package fails to build everywhere else).

 -- Josip Rodin <joy-packages@debian.org>  Sun, 20 Jan 2008 22:08:45 +0100

maildrop (2.0.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dpatch 010-makedat-doc-install.patch which amends top-level
    Makefile.am so that makedat docs are properly installed, like
    everything else is.
  * The makedat program was moved into the maildrop source build as well
    (apparently it used to be disabled by mistake), so added
    the alternatives for it, and a Replaces: courier-base (<= 0.58.0-1),
    closes: #459545.
    Kept makedatprog in /usr/bin, but symlinked makedatprog(1) manpage
    to makedat(1).

 -- Josip Rodin <joy-packages@debian.org>  Sun, 20 Jan 2008 12:13:03 +0100

maildrop (2.0.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
    + Includes Kurt Roeckx's fixes to the build system.
  * Reran autoreconf, which combines with the above changes fixes
    the rpath craziness on amd64 and adds the courier-authlib dependency,
    closes: #395529.
  * Removed s/--mode=link/--quiet --mode=link/ and
    s/--mode=compile/--quiet --mode=compile/ from automake.fix,
    it hides information from build logs (noticed by Kurt).
  * Updated 002-maildrop-debian-paths.patch just to match the new
    offsets in files (no content change).
  * Addressed the inadequacies in the description as reported by Reuben
    Thomas, but without gutting it and instead by describing all the
    additional functions and programs shipped in the package, closes: #396540.

 -- Josip Rodin <joy-packages@debian.org>  Fri, 04 Jan 2008 20:20:13 +0100

maildrop (2.0.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. Out of six changes in it, one is an innocuous
    umask fix in deliverquota, and five are ours:
    + Dropped 001-lockmail-setgid.patch, upstream now does setgid(getgid())
      (as well as setuid(getuid())).
    + Dropped 005-maildrop-dotlock-throw-clarifications.patch, adopted
      upstream.
    + Dropped 006-maildirmake-error-clarification.patch, ditto.
    + Dropped 007-maildirmake.1.quotas.patch, ditto.
    + Dropped 008-maildropex-ref-mailbot.patch, ditto.
    + Dropped 010-maildrop-authlib-optional.patch, ditto.
  * Avoided touching Makefile.am to change the htmldir variable
    (s,$(pkgdatadir)/html,$(datadir)/doc/maildrop/html,) and instead
    done that post res in the rules file, just to avoid running
    automake et al every time.
  * Polished up the package description.

 -- Josip Rodin <joy-packages@debian.org>  Mon,  8 Jan 2007 01:58:36 +0100

maildrop (2.0.2-11) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Revised the patch that made authlib optional to include a new
    command-line option (-a) which can revert it run-time.
    Updated the documentation and NEWS for the former change.
    (This functionality got included in upstream CVS on 2006-10-01, together
    with a new configure option (--enable-authlib-tempreject) which sets the
    default at build-time.)
  * Added build-conflicts with libfam-dev, just in case someone tries it
    like that, closes: #387157.
  * Upped standards version to 3.7.2.

 -- Josip Rodin <joy-packages@debian.org>  Wed, 20 Sep 2006 20:39:29 +0200

maildrop (2.0.2-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Avoid using dh_fixperms -X (via DEB_FIXPERMS_EXCLUDE) because it just
    doesn't work properly, and instead put the chgrp/chmod in the
    binary-predeb/maildrop rule, closes: #386952.
  * Restored the patch to maildrop/deliver.C which avoids an extra newline
    before From_. This had originally fixed bug #156264. (dpatch 009)
  * In the find_in_authlib() function, in case the call to
    auth_getuserinfo() failed, don't throw a temporary failure,
    and instead just return 0 which will make the code which calls
    find_in_authlib proceed as if the user is not found. This pretty
    much handles the upgrades from the old setup, and closes: #314847.
    Note that for the others who want authdaemon but can't reach it,
    maildrop delivery will misbehave, which is bad but not entirely
    unexpected. Thanks to Andres Salomon for the exact patch. (dpatch 010)

 -- Josip Rodin <joy-packages@debian.org>  Tue, 12 Sep 2006 18:53:15 +0200

maildrop (2.0.2-9) unstable; urgency=high

  * (The adding back of #325135 fix fixes CAN-2005-2655.)
  * Updated README.Debian for #82986 fix.
  * Fixed faulty reference to maildir quotas in maildirmake(1),
    closes: #360725. (dpatch 007)
  * Added the workaround for the apparent dh_install vs. sudo problem
    which caused some /etc/maildroprc files to be owned by a user,
    closes: #386700.
  * Mention mailbot in the maildropex manual page, thanks to
    Ralf Hildebrandt, closes: #381540. (dpatch 008)
  * The html/ docs weren't getting installed in the location patched
    by dpatch 002, so re-ran automake (and before that aclocal, because
    we have 1.9.6 and this one's from 1.9.5, waah).
  * Rebuilt with courier-authlib 0.58-4 which has shlibs, and dropped
    the manual dependency. Added the versioned build-dependency on the
    -dev package, at least for now.

 -- Josip Rodin <joy-packages@debian.org>  Sun, 10 Sep 2006 12:17:08 +0200

maildrop (2.0.2-8) unstable; urgency=high

  * Re-added the fix for #82986 - it went into sarge, and I still basically
    agree with the rationale. Filter directory and files being accessible
    to groups and the world is permissible; just check for world-writability.
  * Dumped urgency to high because of this and because of the fix in the
    previous revision (and -6 had just gotten into testing :/).

 -- Josip Rodin <joy-packages@debian.org>  Sun, 10 Sep 2006 00:12:11 +0200

maildrop (2.0.2-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added 006-maildirmake-error-clarifications.patch, which clarifies
    two basic error messages in maildirmake.
  * Added *back* the patch that fixes the privilege escalation in lockmail,
    which was fixed on August 29, 2005, but reintroduced afterwards and
    survived up to now. Damn. Thanks to Andreas Barth for noticing.
    This finally closes: #325135.

 -- Josip Rodin <joy-packages@debian.org>  Sat,  9 Sep 2006 00:18:03 +0200

maildrop (2.0.2-6) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Documented how return_fail_output must be used instead of return_output
    for our pipe transport in Exim, finally closes: #153501.
  * Included the NEWS.Debian entry in the package (d'oh!) and fixed
    the description of the PCRE change impact, thanks to Aaron Schrab,
    closes: #385487.
  * Generalized -d problem description to include Postfix, too.
    I am currently not completely sure how this works without -d, but
    the existing state of my main mail account confirms that it does,
    so there :)
  * Updated the last tidbit in README.Debian to reflect current situation -
    we don't omit the o-r restriction on .mailfilter at this time.
    (Don't ask me why...)

 -- Josip Rodin <joy-packages@debian.org>  Thu, 31 Aug 2006 12:29:05 +0200

maildrop (2.0.2-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Noted documentation for the courier-authlib issue in the NEWS.Debian
    entry (it's described in INSTALL).
  * Updated the MTA explicit+pipe dependency to Exim 4, closes: #228581.
  * Added maildirquota manual page to the alternatives, due to conflict
    with courier-base, closes: #253092.

 -- Josip Rodin <joy-packages@debian.org>  Wed, 30 Aug 2006 14:06:05 +0200

maildrop (2.0.2-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Introduced courier-authlib as a dependency, which might actually be
    wrong but goes a bit further in fixing all the aspects of #314847.
  * Added 005-maildrop-dotlock-throw-clarifications.patch, which clarifies
    three error messages WRT dot-locking.

 -- Josip Rodin <joy-packages@debian.org>  Mon, 28 Aug 2006 18:22:23 +0200

maildrop (2.0.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload to unstable.
  * Added a NEWS.Debian file outlining the major incompatibility changes
    between 1.x and 2.x.
  * Updated README.Debian bits about the -d option, noted the generic
    sendmail example etc.

 -- Josip Rodin <joy-packages@debian.org>  Mon, 28 Aug 2006 01:41:20 +0200

maildrop (2.0.2-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Added the forgotten new build dependency on PCRE, closes: #381097.

 -- Josip Rodin <joy-packages@debian.org>  Fri, 25 Aug 2006 22:39:25 +0200

maildrop (2.0.2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Dropped 001-maildrop-fhs-var-mail.patch, dilinger's patch got included
    upstream on 2005-06-18.
  * Dropped 003-maildrop-maildropfilter-typo.patch, it's upstream.
  * Updated copyright file with new URL and extended copyright.

 -- Josip Rodin <joy-packages@debian.org>  Sat, 29 Jul 2006 12:38:17 +0200

maildrop (1.8.1-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Build against courier's authlib; this allows for more flexible
    authentication (closes: #212701, #222421, #303458).

 -- Andres Salomon <dilinger@debian.org>  Thu, 16 Jun 2005 00:05:00 -0400

maildrop (1.8.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #272171).
  * Add myself as a co-maintainer.
  * Convert build system to cdbs.  We'll keep the old build system around
    for a bit, 'cause it's cool.

 -- Andres Salomon <dilinger@debian.org>  Wed, 15 Jun 2005 13:09:56 -0400

maildrop (1.5.3-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Add myself as a co-maintainer.
  * Ack NMU (closes: #265399).
  * [SECURITY] Fix privilege escalation bug, whereby one can obtain access
    to group "mail"; lockmail forgets to drop privs.  Thanks to Max Vozeler
    (CAN-2005-2655) (closes: #325135).

 -- Andres Salomon <dilinger@debian.org>  Mon, 29 Aug 2005 12:52:46 -0400

maildrop (1.5.3-1.1) unstable; urgency=low

maildrop (1.5.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

    + Adds missing "d" (delete) in the sed example in maildropex(5),
      closes: #198016.
  * Updated gdbm build-dep, closes: #199601.
  * Provide an alternative for the maildir(5) manual page, closes: #187256.

    pages, closes: #197730.
  * Fixed typo in reformime.1, closes: #198034.
  * Added a missing clause in maildropex(5), closes: #198163.
  * Added convenience manual page aliases maildroprc(5) and mailfilter(5),

 -- Josip Rodin <joy-packages@debian.org>  Wed,  2 Jul 2003 00:40:42 +0200

maildrop (1.5.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.

    world/group-readable in maildrop/main.C, closes: #82986.
  * Set the location of system mailboxes to /var/mail.

  * Removed the virtual accounts section from the maildrop manual page,
    closes: #141398.
  * Fixed error handling in maildrop/main.C so that it distinguishes
    between different types of problems, closes: #169252.
  * The header-adding option now documented as -A (not -a) in maildrop(1),
    closes: #153511.
  * Replaced dotlock alternative with lockmail.

 -- Josip Rodin <joy-packages@debian.org>  Sat,  8 Mar 2003 17:58:48 +0100

maildrop (1.4.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Undid the extra \n before From_ change, again. mutt is still bitching. :(

 -- Josip Rodin <jrodin@jagor.srce.hr>  Fri, 28 Jun 2002 20:01:57 +0200

maildrop (1.3.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

maildrop (1.3.7-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Removed the incredibly stupid and pointless dh_installmanpages call from
    debian/rules. Other than valid manual pages for binaries we install,
    it was installing the makedat manual page which we don't need, and two
    RFCs manual pages that we don't need or want, either. Gah!
    This fixes the conflict with courier-base over makedat.1, closes: #134639.

 -- Josip Rodin <jrodin@jagor.srce.hr>  Tue, 19 Feb 2002 20:37:37 +0100

maildrop (1.3.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Reverted the patch that added \n to the start of every message
    in maildrop/formatmbox.C, because it breaks creation of new mailboxes
    and makes mutt think old messages were modified and bitch about it,
    closes: #130516, #132411.
  * Performed some surgery on maildir/Makefile.am in order to unfuck it.

 -- Josip Rodin <jrodin@jagor.srce.hr>  Sat, 16 Feb 2002 17:28:02 +0100

maildrop (1.3.6-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Enable flock again (WTH was it disabled? It was enabled in 0.75-2!).

 -- Josip Rodin <jrodin@jagor.srce.hr>  Sat,  2 Feb 2002 22:48:56 +0100

maildrop (1.3.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version, closes: #127435.
    Had to tweak maildir/Makefile.am to make it compile, feh.
  * Fixed the "package (binary)" list in README.Debian, closes: #119116.

  * Moved deliverquota(.maildrop) to /usr/sbin, where it seems to belong.
  * Standards-Version: 3.5.2. Added build-depends on libgdbmg1-dev.
  * Added maildroptips.txt to the documentation directory, closes: #83953.
  * Removed dh_suidregister invocation and added Conflicts: suidmanager
    (<< 0.50) in the control file.
  * Added "exim | " to mail-transport-agent dependency, to quiet down
    Lintian.
  * Rewrote rules file in shell.

 -- Josip Rodin <jrodin@jagor.srce.hr>  Sat, 10 Feb 2001 15:58:28 +0100

maildrop (1.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer, closes: #78321.
  * Removed mode u+s from maildrop binary (?!).
  * Removed a pile of needless stuff from the .diff by fixing
    Makefile.am, maildir/Makefile.am, and and configure.in.
  * Added complete set of alternatives for deliverquota, too (because it
    looks as if courier-imap provides its own one).
  * Updated the README about the above change, and other things. Added
    description of how the s[ug]id stuff is handled, and how to set up
    maildrop as a MDA in Exim and Postfix.
  * Added README.html to the doc dir. I'd add README.postfix, too, but it
